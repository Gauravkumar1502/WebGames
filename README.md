## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `docs/` directory.
<!-- change the --base-href to your repository name in the package.json file -->
Before running the build command, change the `--base-href` to your repository name in the `package.json` file.

For example, if your repository name is `my-first-project`, then the script should look like this in the `package.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
    "build": "ng build --base-href=https://<your-github-username>.github.io/my-first-project/"
    },
```
